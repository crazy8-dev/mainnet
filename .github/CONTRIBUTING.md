# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your intention to contribute to the Insolar project. As an open-source based company, we highly appreciate external contributions to our project.

To make the process smooth for the project committers (those who review and accept changes) and contributors (those who propose new changes via pull requests), there are a few rules to follow.

## Code Contribution Process

Please feel free to submit issues, fork the repository and send pull requests!

When submitting an issue, we ask that you please include a complete test function that demonstrates the issue.

It would be great if you follow Go best coding practices, write tests and rationalize your choices via discussion and code itself.
